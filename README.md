Variables Declaration
  â€¢	tempSensorPin = A0;
  
    o	Defines the analog pin (A0) where the temperature sensor is connected.
    
  â€¢	photoResistorPin = A2;
  
    o	Defines the analog pin (A2) where the photoresistor (light sensor) is connected.
    
  â€¢	ledPin = 12;
  
    o	Defines the digital pin (12) where the LED is connected.
    
  â€¢	tempThreshold = 50;
  
    o	Sets the temperature threshold (50Â°C) at which the LED should respond.
    
  â€¢	brightnessThreshold = 220;
  
    o	Sets the brightness threshold (220) from the photoresistor to trigger the LED.

Setup Function

  â€¢	The setup() function runs once when the program starts.
  
  â€¢	pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  
    o	Configures the LED pin as an output so it can be controlled.
    
  â€¢	Serial.begin(9600);
  
    o	Initializes serial communication at a baud rate of 9600 for debugging.
________________________________________

Loop Function (Runs Continuously)

  â€¢	Reads sensor values and controls the LED based on temperature and brightness conditions.
  
1. Reading Temperature Sensor
   
    int tempValue = analogRead(tempSensorPin);

    float voltage = tempValue * (5.0 / 1023.0);

    float temperatureC = (voltage - 0.5) * 100.0;

  â€¢	Reads the analog value from the temperature sensor.
  
  â€¢	Converts the sensor reading into voltage using 5.0 / 1023.0.
  
  â€¢	Converts the voltage to Celsius using the formula (voltage - 0.5) * 100.0.
  
2. Reading Brightness from the Photoresistor
   
    int brightnessValue = analogRead(photoResistorPin);

  â€¢	Reads the analog value from the photoresistor (ranges from 0 to 1023).
  
3. Displaying Values on Serial Monitor

    Serial.print("Temperature: ");

    Serial.print(temperatureC);

    Serial.print(" Â°C, Brightness: ");

    Serial.println(brightnessValue);
   
  â€¢ Prints the temperature (Â°C) and brightness level to the serial monitor for debugging.
  
5. Controlling the LED Based on Conditions
   
if (temperatureC >= tempThreshold && brightnessValue >= brightnessThreshold) {

      digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  
      delay(100);
    
      digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
  
      delay(100);
  
    } else {

  digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
}
  â€¢	If both conditions are met:

    o	Temperature is â‰¥ 50Â°C.
   
    o	Brightness is â‰¥ 220.
   
    o	The LED blinks (ON for 100ms, OFF for 100ms).
   
  â€¢	If the conditions aren't met, the LED stays OFF.
  
6. Small Delay Before Next Loop Cycle

  delay(100);

  â€¢	Adds a 100ms delay before repeating the loop to reduce rapid sensor readings.

Program Behavior

    â€¢	The system monitors temperature and brightness in real time.
  
    â€¢	If both conditions (temp â‰¥ 50Â°C and brightness â‰¥ 220) are met, the LED blinks.
  
    â€¢	Otherwise, the LED stays OFF.

    â€¢	Data is printed to the Serial Monitor for tracking sensor values.
  
This program is useful for applications like environment monitoring, where an LED can indicate overheating and high brightness levels. ðŸš€
